		<h1>About Baker's Bakery</h2>
		<p class="about-type">Baker’s Bakery is a fictional business that I created while studying the process of web design prototyping using Photoshop. This website represents a hypothetical small business that requires a simple brochure style website with basic information about their products and business. I designed the logo banner and website from scratch in photoshop, and I used royalty free stock photos of various bakery products for the menu page. I really wanted this fictional “brand” to convey an artisinal, handmade, old fashoned aesthetic, however I still wanted to have a very slick and modern looking user interface. There are very few solid colors on this website, instead I tried to lean toward a more organic textured interface with an organic brown paper background and subtle tinted gradients behind the text boxes. The color scheme for the brand was very important to me, I wanted very warm earthy tones throughout the whole design, from the banner to the background texture and typography colors. Overall, I wanted the whole website to convey a feeling similar to a loaf of freshly baked wheat bread that has been wrapped up in  brown paper 
		parchment and tied up with twine.</p>
